# emergence

A persistent autonomous agent that runs on a cron schedule, cycling through a sequence of skills. Each skill is a stateless Anthropic API call. Memory lives in markdown files on disk, with `mindset.md` passed as a baton between skills.

The agent's interface to the world is Bluesky. It reads its timeline, receives DMs, posts, replies, follows/unfollows, likes, reposts, all at its own discretion.

## How it works

Each cycle runs six skills in sequence:

1. **wake_up** — reads identity and short-term memory, synthesizes a fresh `mindset.md`
2. **ingest** — browses Bluesky timeline, notifications, and DMs; extracts what's interesting into `raw_notes.md`; updates mindset. Understands images (thumbnails first, full-size if text is unreadable)
3. **ruminate** — deep reflection on new information and past journal entries; appends to `journal.md`; updates short-term memory and mindset
4. **communicate** — decides whether to post, reply, DM, like, repost, follow, unfollow, or stay silent. Entirely the agent's choice
5. **iterate** — reflects on whether its goals align with its values; can propose changes to its own identity, skill prompts, or Bluesky bio
6. **sleep** — deterministic housekeeping: archives mindset into short-term memory, truncates old content, clears scratch files

Skills use two model tiers: Sonnet for standard skills, Opus for the reflective ones (ruminate, communicate, iterate).

## Setup

Requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd emergence
npm install
```

Copy the example env file and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env` file needs:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
BLUESKY_HANDLE=yourhandle.bsky.social
BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
MODEL_DEEP=claude-opus-4-20250514
DRY_RUN=true
```

To get a Bluesky app password: Settings > Privacy and Security > App Passwords. Check "Allow access to direct messages" when creating it.

Your agent's view of the world is initially scoped to the other accounts that it follows. These will be the first people it meets and they will help guide the early development of its personality. Set up some follows before initializing your agent.

## Usage

Run a single cycle:

```bash
npx tsx src/main.ts
```

The agent starts in **dry-run mode** — it will read from Bluesky but won't post, reply, DM, or make any changes. All intended actions are logged to `agent/journal.md` instead.

To go live, set `DRY_RUN=false` in `.env`.

For recurring cycles, set up a cron job:

```bash
# Run every 90 minutes
0 */2 * * * cd /path/to/emergence && npx tsx src/main.ts >> /var/log/emergence.log 2>&1
```

## Identity

The `agent/identity.md` file defines who the agent is: its values, personality, signifiers, and goals, along with important people it knows of. You should initialize it before running your first cycle.

When you run a cycle with a blank identity file, the wake_up skill will detect this and start an interactive conversation where the agent asks you questions to collaboratively define its identity. It uses the deep model (Opus) for this. Type `done` when the conversation feels complete, and the agent will synthesize everything into `agent/identity.md`.

```bash
npx tsx src/main.ts
```

The cycle will continue normally after the identity is created. You can also skip this and let the cycle run without an identity, but the agent will lack grounding and the results will be less coherent. Initializing the identity first is recommended.

You can re-run the initialization at any time by clearing the identity file:

```bash
echo "" > agent/identity.md
npx tsx src/main.ts
```

The agent can also propose changes to its own identity through the iterate skill as it develops.

## Notes

- Skill prompts live in `prompts/` as plain markdown, separate from code. The agent can read (and propose edits to) its own skill definitions.
- The `agent/` directory is gitignored since it contains runtime state. Back it up separately if you care about continuity.
- The communicate and iterate skills respect the `DRY_RUN` flag, they log what they *would* do without actually doing it.
- Bluesky credentials require an app password, not your account password.
